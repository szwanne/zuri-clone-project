## 🧠 What I Learned

- Adding animation to the website, specifically to the "Grid Section" which transformed the grid items to move upwards when you hover over them.
- Using span tag as divider for my website layout.

## 🔍 What I struggled with

- I tried to use pseudo-elements to the "Grid Section" to make the first grid-item red and using positioning to align the rest of the other grid.
- I need to understand how to make the background image inherit the overall background of the website.
